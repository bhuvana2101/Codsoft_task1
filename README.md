A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet. These bots are programmed to understand questions, provide answers, and engage in dialogue just like a real person would. Chatbots can be found in various applications, such as customer service, online shopping, healthcare, and more.

The functionality of a chatbot is based on artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies. AI allows the chatbot to learn from interactions and improve responses over time, making it more effective in understanding and addressing user queries. NLP enables the chatbot to comprehend and generate human language, facilitating seamless communication.

Chatbots can be categorized into rule-based and AI-based chatbots. Rule-based chatbots follow predefined rules and patterns to respond to user inputs, while AI-based chatbots use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to interpret and generate responses based on a vast amount of data and patterns.

Overall, chatbots offer various benefits, such as 24/7 availability, quick responses, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for businesses. They enhance user experience by providing instant support and information. As technology advances, chatbots continue to evolve, becoming more sophisticated and capable of handling complex interactions.
